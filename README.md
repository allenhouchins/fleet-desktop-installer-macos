# fleet-desktop-installer-macos
Fleet Desktop Installer for macOS

This package will install and enable Fleet Desktop for your macOS devices in which you've already installed the Fleet Agent without Fleet Desktop included. This package assumes you have already deployed the Fleet Agent without the "--fleet-desktop" flag present during initial package creation.
